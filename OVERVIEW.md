# Privacy-Preserving Verification of ElizaOS Character Files on Midnight

## Introduction  
ElizaOS provides **character.json** files that define an AI agent’s persona, but sharing these files publicly can leak sensitive details. We need a solution to **prove specific statements about an agent’s character file are true or false _without_ revealing the file’s content**. The approach will leverage **Midnight**, Cardano’s privacy-focused partner chain, which uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to allow selective disclosure on a blockchain ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Its%20distributed%20ledger%20architecture%20increases,in%20use%20cases%20such%20as)). In essence, we will create a system where an agent owner can generate a ZK proof off-chain attesting to a property of the JSON, and a Midnight smart contract will verify this proof on-chain. This will confirm statements like *“the agent’s lore does not instruct it to reveal secrets”* or *“the agent’s topics include Cardano”* without exposing the actual lore or topics text. The following plan outlines the character file structure, the zero-knowledge proof strategy, recommended ZK technologies (SNARKs/STARKs/Halo2), and the architecture for off-chain proof generation and on-chain verification.

## ElizaOS Character JSON Structure and Verifiable Facts  
The **ElizaOS `character.json`** is a structured JSON document describing an AI agent’s identity, background, and behavior. It has a publicly documented schema with fields such as name, biography, lore, style guidelines, etc ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=%7B%20%22%24schema%22%3A%20%22http%3A%2F%2Fjson,user)). Key sections of the file include:  

- **Name** – The character’s name (string).  
- **Bio** – An array of short biographical snippets about the character ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=character.,user)). These might state personal background or personality facts.  
- **Lore** – An array of factual or historical snippets about the character ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=character.,user)). This often encodes the character’s history or important truths in their world.  
- **Message Examples** – Sample dialogue snippets (as arrays of message objects) to illustrate how the character converses.  
- **Post Examples** – Example social media posts by the character (array of strings).  
- **Adjectives** – A list of descriptive traits or adjectives for the character.  
- **Topics** – A list of topics the character is interested in ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=,1)) (e.g. “finance”, “blockchain”, “Cardano”).  
- **Knowledge** – An optional list of knowledge items, each with an `id`, a `path` to a source file, and full `content` text that the character “knows” ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=,content)). This could include articles or documents the agent has read.  
- **Style** – An object defining stylistic guidelines for the character’s speech. It contains sub-fields like `all`, `chat`, and `post` which are arrays of instructions (e.g. writing style rules) ([github.com](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/raw/refs/heads/main/schema/character.schema.json#:~:text=,)) ([characterfile/examples/example.character.json at main · elizaOS/characterfile · GitHub](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/blob/main/examples/example.character.json#:~:text=)). For example, a style rule might be *“never use hashtags or emojis”* or *“don't act like an assistant”* as shown in the official example file ([characterfile/examples/example.character.json at main · elizaOS/characterfile · GitHub](https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile/blob/main/examples/example.character.json#:~:text=)).

Using this structure, we can extract **facts** that we might want to prove or disprove without full disclosure. For instance: 

- *Inclusion proofs:* Prove that a certain piece of data **is present** in the character file. e.g. *“The agent’s topics include ‘Cardano’.”* This corresponds to checking if `"Cardano"` appears in the `topics` array. Similarly, we could prove *“The agent is instructed to 'never use emojis' in its style”* by checking the `style.all` list for that exact instruction. If a specific belief or knowledge about a token is claimed, we might look in the `knowledge` content or `lore` for that token’s name. For example, if the agent supposedly holds a belief about a token, a proof could show that a statement about that token exists in the `knowledge` texts or `lore` snippets.  
- *Exclusion proofs:* Prove that certain content is **not present** in the file. e.g. *“The character’s bio/lore does **not** contain any instructions to promote token X.”* This could mean checking that nowhere in the `bio` or `lore` arrays (or in `knowledge.content`) does the string “token X” appear. Another example: *“The agent is **not** coded to act maliciously”* could be interpreted as proving that no `lore` or `style` entry contains disallowed behavior (like “attack” or “deceive”). Essentially, an exclusion proof shows a given phrase or fact is absent from all relevant fields.

Because the JSON is well-structured, each of these claims can be reduced to a **check on specific fields or values** in the file. This structure will guide our zero-knowledge circuit design – for example, a circuit can target the `topics` list for a membership test, or iterate over all `lore` strings to ensure none match a forbidden pattern. The design will treat each snippet or list item as a potential *fact* to be validated by the proof.

## Privacy-Preserving Proof Strategy  
To verify statements about the character file without revealing it, we leverage **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**. A ZKP can prove a statement about secret data is true, without revealing the data itself ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Its%20distributed%20ledger%20architecture%20increases,in%20use%20cases%20such%20as)). Our approach will have the agent owner use the character JSON as *private input* (witness data) to a ZK proving circuit, and produce a proof that a certain condition holds. The condition will correspond to the statement we want to verify (e.g. “topic == Cardano?” or “no forbidden phrase in lore”). The proof is then published for on-chain verification, but **the JSON content remains hidden**. Only the truth of the statement is revealed.

**Key idea – Commitment to the character file:** First, the character file can be cryptographically committed to ensure integrity. For example, we can take a hash of the entire `character.json` (or a Merkle root if we structure it as a Merkle tree of fields). This hash can serve as a **commitment** to the file’s contents. We might store this hash on-chain as a public reference to the agent’s configuration. All proofs will be made relative to this committed hash (i.e. the proof will ensure it is proving a property about the same file that produced that hash). This way, anyone verifying the proof knows it pertains to one specific, fixed file version. The commitment itself does not reveal anything about the file (since a secure hash is one-way), but it links all subsequent proofs to a consistent data set.

**Proving inclusion of a fact:** To prove a statement **is true** (e.g. “the agent’s topics include X”), the ZK circuit will check that at least one element of the relevant JSON field equals the target value. For structured fields like `topics` or `adjectives` (which are lists of single words/phrases), the circuit can simply iterate over the list and assert that one of the entries matches the query string. For example, the circuit takes as public input the query `"Cardano"` and outputs 1 (true) if and only if one of the `topics` equals `"Cardano"` ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Its%20distributed%20ledger%20architecture%20increases,in%20use%20cases%20such%20as)). All the actual topic strings are kept private inside the proof. If the proof verifies, it guarantees *without revealing the list* that the given topic was indeed present. For longer text fields (like a lore sentence or knowledge content), an inclusion proof might be checking for a **substring or keyword**. This can be done by a simple text-search circuit (which might be more complex), or by a cryptographic trick: for instance, each lore snippet could be hashed, and the circuit could check that the hash of some snippet equals the hash of the target phrase. The actual phrase remains secret unless it’s exactly the one queried. In summary, the inclusion proof will provide a yes/no answer confirming the presence of a specific trait or keyword in the JSON.

**Proving exclusion of a fact:** To prove a statement **is false** (e.g. “the lore does *not* mention token Y”), the circuit must show that none of the JSON fields in question contain the disallowed value. This involves verifying a condition over all items in a field. For example, to prove “token Y is nowhere in the knowledge content,” the circuit can scan each knowledge item’s content (or their hashes) and assert that `Y` is not equal to any substring/token in those texts. Another approach is to use a Merkle tree: commit each item in a Merkle tree, and prove that a given value *cannot* be found by showing a non-membership proof in a Merkle set. However, implementing a **non-membership proof** on arbitrary text can be complex. Instead, a brute-force check in the circuit (going through each list entry and ensuring none match the forbidden value) is straightforward given the data sizes (the agent’s fields are of moderate length). The circuit yields a boolean output (true = “no match found”). If the proof verifies this output, it assures that the forbidden string truly does not appear in those parts of the character file, without revealing any of the actual content.

Notably, Midnight’s architecture is designed for such selective disclosures – a smart contract can prove a property about private data and only disclose the truth value of that property ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=On%20the%20chain%2C%20this%20interaction,would%20have%20the%20following%20interactions)) ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Its%20distributed%20ledger%20architecture%20increases,in%20use%20cases%20such%20as)). This means on-chain we might only reveal **“YES, the agent has property X”** or **“NO, the agent does not have property Y”**, and nothing else about the JSON. The character file remains shielded. By carefully designing the proving circuits around the known JSON schema, we ensure that we extract just the right fact (inclusion or exclusion) as the public output of the proof, and everything else stays private.

## Off-Chain ZK Proof Generation  
All heavy computation for the proofs will occur **off-chain, on the prover’s side (the agent owner’s environment)**. The agent owner will use a ZK prover toolkit to generate the proof that their `character.json` satisfies the desired property. We can leverage Midnight’s developer tools or external ZK libraries to accomplish this:

1. **Circuit Design:** First, we implement the ZK circuit (the mathematical program) that encodes the statement logic. In Midnight’s model, this can be done in its native smart contract language **Compact**, which is a TypeScript-based DSL ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20uses%20TypeScript,attestation%20without%20revealing%20sensitive%20information)). We define the character’s structure in the circuit – for example, as separate witness variables for `name`, `bio[]`, `lore[]`, etc., or perhaps as one opaque JSON object that our circuit’s code will traverse. Each part of the JSON that we need to check will be accessed in the circuit as private inputs (*witness data* in ZK terms). For instance, we could declare a witness function like `witness getCharacter(): CharacterStruct;` which the off-chain code will supply with the actual JSON content. The circuit code will then perform checks like:  
   ```typescript
   // Pseudo-code illustrating circuit logic
   let char = getCharacter();           // private witness: full character data
   let query = publicInputToken;        // public input: the token or phrase we’re checking
   let found = false;
   for (let topic of char.topics) {
       if (topic == query) {
           found = true;
       }
   }
   assert(found == true);  // If we expect inclusion, require found==true (for exclusion, require false)
   ```  
   This is a simplified illustration – real code would consider string comparison logic. In practice, we might convert strings to a fixed-length byte array or hash within the circuit. For example, we could use a hash function (Poseidon or similar) inside the circuit to compare hashed values instead of raw strings, which can be more ZK-efficient. The main point is that the circuit will encode the condition (found vs not found) as a constraint to be satisfied.  

2. **Tooling and Circuit Implementation:** We have two primary options for implementing the circuit:
   - *Using Midnight’s SDK:* Midnight’s **Compact** language and **standard library** allow developers to write ZK circuits in a high-level way ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20uses%20TypeScript,attestation%20without%20revealing%20sensitive%20information)). The developer can write TypeScript-like code to express the checks on the character file. The Midnight toolchain will compile this to a proving circuit automatically (handling the transformation to a ZK-SNARK behind the scenes ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=The%20above%20program%20can%20be,interactions%20can%20be%20converted%20into))). The character file’s data would be provided via **witness callbacks** – for example, the DApp (off-chain) can implement `getCharacter()` to read the JSON file from disk and feed its content into the proving process. This process is described in Midnight’s docs: witness data comes from external callbacks and is used inside the proof without being revealed unless explicitly allowed ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=The%20contract%20produced%20from%20a,considered%20to%20be%20witness%20data)). The Compact compiler will also produce the necessary proving and verification keys for the circuit. 
   - *Using an external ZK framework:* Alternatively, one could use established ZK languages like **Circom** or **Noir** to write the circuit for the JSON property check. For instance, with Circom we could write a circuit that takes the hash of each topic and compares to the hash of the query. After writing the circuit, we would compile it to R1CS, generate a proving key (with a trusted setup if using Groth16, or a universal setup for PLONK), and then use a prover (like snarkjs or a Halo2-based prover) to create the proof. This approach gives more control over the proof system (Groth16, PLONK, Halo2, etc.), but it would then require a custom verification on-chain. If we plan to verify on Midnight, we’d need either to integrate that external proof verification into a Midnight contract or rely on Midnight’s native proving (which is more seamless). In general, since Midnight is built to handle ZK proofs natively, using its ecosystem (Compact language and APIs) is the most straightforward route.

3. **Providing the Witness (Character Data):** The agent owner prepares their `character.json` as input. This JSON must be in a format the circuit expects (likely the same structured schema). The owner’s off-chain application (perhaps a Node.js script using the **Midnight DApp Connector API** ([Midnight APIs | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/#:~:text=Collection%20of%20Midnight%20APIs%3A))) will load the JSON file and supply it to the circuit’s witness interface. For example, if using the Compact contract, the owner calls the contract’s proof generation function, and the SDK will invoke the `getCharacter()` callback to retrieve the JSON content. All of this happens off-chain on the owner’s machine; the JSON is never sent to the chain or any other party, it’s only used locally to compute the proof. 

4. **Proof Generation:** Using the proving key and the provided witness data, the ZK library computes a proof. In the case of Midnight’s system, the **Compact runtime** will produce a Zero-knowledge SNARK proof artifact as part of preparing a transaction ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=The%20contract%20produced%20from%20a,considered%20to%20be%20witness%20data)). If using an external tool like Circom/Halo2, the result will be a proof (e.g. a Groth16 proof consisting of a few curve points, or a STARK proof which is a set of FRI commitments, etc.). This proof essentially states: “I know secret data (the JSON) that satisfies the following conditions (e.g. contains topic X and has hash H)”. Importantly, the proof will typically include as **public inputs** the commitment hash of the JSON and the query (and the expected result if needed). These public inputs tie the proof to a specific JSON commit and the statement being proven. 

At this stage, we have an off-chain generated zk-proof that a certain statement about the character file is true. The next step is to make this proof **verifiable on-chain** so that anyone (or any contract) can trust it.

## On-Chain Verification with Midnight Smart Contracts  
 ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/)) *Illustration of Midnight’s selective disclosure paradigm: the user (agent owner) keeps the character file private and only submits ZK proofs. The Midnight contract updates public state or outcomes (unshielded data) without revealing the private inputs. In this way, verifiers (on-chain or off-chain) learn the truth of the statement but **no sensitive data** ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20when,be%20on%20the%20public%20ledger)).*  

Once the proof is generated, the agent owner will submit it to a Midnight smart contract for verification. In Midnight, smart contracts are themselves ZK circuits that run as part of transaction validation ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=To%20move%20beyond%20this%20problem%2C,on%20the%20user%27s%20local%20machine)) ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=Transcripts%20and%20ZK%20Snarks)). There are two slightly different ways to handle verification on-chain, depending on how we implemented the proof:

- **Using a Compact smart contract (native method):** If we used Midnight’s Compact language to create the circuit, the verification is implicit. In Midnight’s model, the contract’s execution produces a proof which the network nodes verify automatically when the transaction is processed ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=Transcripts%20and%20ZK%20Snarks)). In practice, the agent owner would create a transaction calling a contract entry point (for example, `verifyTopicPresence(topicQuery)` in a deployed contract) and include their private character data as witness input to that transaction. The Midnight runtime will generate a proof that the contract’s conditions hold (this is essentially the same proof we described in Off-Chain generation, but now bundled as a transaction). The contract might be designed to then **record the result on-chain**, such as: 
  - Storing the disclosed commitment hash of the character file in the contract’s state (to identify which file was verified) – this would use an explicit `disclose()` in the contract code to write the hash to a public ledger field ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=Explicitly%20declaring%20intent%20to%20disclose,by%20the%20following%20trivial%20program)). 
  - Storing or emitting an event that the property was verified true/false. For example, the contract could have a public boolean field `propertyVerified` or could log something like *“File H satisfies property P.”* This public output is safe to reveal because it contains no secret info beyond the truth value of P for file H. 

  The important part is that the **Midnight network will only accept the transaction if the ZK proof is valid** (i.e. the secret JSON did indeed satisfy the checks) ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=On%20the%20chain%2C%20this%20interaction,would%20have%20the%20following%20interactions)). If someone tries to submit a false claim, the proof verification fails and the transaction is rejected. Thus, on-chain verification is guaranteed by the ZK-SNARK proof system integrated into the Midnight ledger. Other parties can look at the blockchain state or event and see that, for example, hash `H` has been certified to contain topic `"Cardano"` (without anyone ever seeing the actual content that led to that certification).

- **Using an external proof and a verifier contract:** If we generated the proof using an external system (say a Groth16 proof via Circom), we would need a smart contract on Midnight that knows how to verify it. In a typical blockchain like Ethereum, this would mean deploying the proof’s **verifying key** and running a verification algorithm inside the contract. Midnight is a bit different since it emphasizes doing computations in ZK off-chain. However, we could still create a Compact contract whose sole job is to verify a given proof blob against a public key. For instance, Input-Output Global (Cardano’s developers) recently demonstrated verifying a Halo2 proof on-chain using Plutus smart contracts ([Cardano deploys first zero-knowledge smart contract, expanding blockchain capabilities](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-deploys-first-zero-knowledge-smart-contract-expanding-blockchain-capabilities/#:~:text=The%20ZK%20smart%20contract%20Halo2,Midnight%2C%20to%20integrate%20with%20Cardano)), which shows it’s feasible to verify SNARKs on Cardano. On Midnight, we could embed a similar verification logic: e.g. include a known verification circuit (for Halo2 or Groth16) inside a Compact program. The user would then present the proof as part of the transaction (perhaps as an opaque byte array input), and the contract’s circuit would run the verify algorithm on it. If it returns true, the contract could then record the result. This approach is more complex (essentially doing a zk-verifier inside another zk-proof), but it may be useful if we prefer using an external circuit DSL. In most cases, this indirection isn’t necessary because Midnight contracts can directly express the property we want to prove, as described above.

In either scenario, **Midnight’s privacy features ensure that only the intended information is public**. The character file remains shielded (unrevealed) on-chain, and only the commitment and the specific true/false outcome are public. This satisfies the goal of verifiability: anyone can check the blockchain and see that a certain `character.json` (identified by its hash) was proven to have or not have a given property, and they trust it because the proof was verified by the network’s consensus. Meanwhile, the actual contents of the character file are never exposed, preserving the owner’s privacy and the character’s secret design.

As illustrated above, Midnight’s design allows the user to retain **Private Data** and submit only **Proofs, not sensitive data** to the blockchain ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20when,be%20on%20the%20public%20ledger)). The on-chain contract state can differentiate **Unshielded Data** (the minimal disclosures like the booleans or hashes visible to all) from **Shielded Data** (the hidden content that was proven about) ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Image)). For example, a company or third-party can query the contract and see *no metadata* about the character except that “property X was verified”. This fulfills the use-case of, say, a community wanting assurance about an AI agent (that it’s not malicious or biased) without requiring the agent creator to publish their entire configuration.

## Choosing a ZK Proof System (SNARKs, STARKs, Halo2)  
Selecting the right zero-knowledge proof system is crucial for efficiency and security. Below we compare options and recommend one for this Midnight-based solution:

- **zk-SNARK (Groth16 or PLONK):** zk-SNARKs are succinct non-interactive proofs widely used in blockchain applications. Groth16 (used in Zcash) produces very short proofs and extremely fast verification, but requires a trusted setup ceremony for each circuit. PLONK is a newer SNARK that is universal (one setup for many circuits) and updatable, reducing the trust concerns, but still has a structured reference string. Both Groth16 and PLONK have proof sizes on the order of a few hundred bytes and verification costs that are low (a few pairings) – suitable for on-chain verification. They are **efficient** but the downside is the need to establish trust in the setup phase. In our context, if we used Circom to generate a Groth16 proof, we’d need to trust that the toxic waste from setup was destroyed. That might not be ideal for an open verification scenario. PLONK’s universal setup is more flexible and could be reused. Notably, Cardano’s Midnight places emphasis on upgradable proving systems and developer ease ([index | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/#:~:text=flexibility%20when%20selecting%20which%20data,and%20begin%20writing%20smart%20contracts)), which suggests they might support PLONK-like protocols under the hood. 

- **Halo2 (trustless zkSNARK):** **Halo 2** is a proving system developed by the Electric Coin Company (ECC) as an evolution of Halo and PLONK. It is a SNARK that **does not require a trusted setup** (it uses discrete log assumptions with elliptic curves and can achieve recursive proof composition). Halo2 is particularly attractive because it can recursively verify proofs (enabling scalability like rollups) and it aligns with a need for trustless verification. Cardano has explicitly been adopting Halo2: the first ZK smart contract on Cardano mainnet was based on Halo2, eliminating the need for a trusted setup ([Cardano deploys first zero-knowledge smart contract, expanding blockchain capabilities](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-deploys-first-zero-knowledge-smart-contract-expanding-blockchain-capabilities/#:~:text=The%20ZK%20smart%20contract%20Halo2,Midnight%2C%20to%20integrate%20with%20Cardano)). Moreover, the Midnight team has worked with partners (like Galois) to implement recursive proofs in Halo2 for Midnight ([Galois - Midnight and Halo2: ZK Rollups for Secure Scalability](https://www.galois.com/articles/midnight-and-halo2-zk-rollups-for-secure-scalability#:~:text=Galois%20recently%20wrapped%20up%20a,source%20ZK%20library%20called%20Halo2)). In fact, Midnight’s ZK architecture uses the **Halo2 cryptographic framework with customized curves (Pluto and Eris)** to support trustless operations ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20is%20designed%20to%20function,interoperability%20for%20hybrid%20blockchain%20applications)). This indicates that Halo2 is the *natural choice* for proofs on Midnight. By using Halo2, we benefit from:  
  - *No trusted setup:* We don’t have to run a ceremony; anyone can verify proofs without setup assumptions ([Cardano deploys first zero-knowledge smart contract, expanding blockchain capabilities](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-deploys-first-zero-knowledge-smart-contract-expanding-blockchain-capabilities/#:~:text=The%20ZK%20smart%20contract%20Halo2,Midnight%2C%20to%20integrate%20with%20Cardano)).  
  - *Compatibility:* It’s already integrated with Cardano’s toolchain and Midnight’s sidechain, meaning there may be native support to verify Halo2 proofs or even native generation via the Compact language.  
  - *Recursion:* If our application ever needed to aggregate multiple proofs (say proving multiple properties about the JSON in one go, or batching many verifications), Halo2 can support recursive proving efficiently ([Galois - Midnight and Halo2: ZK Rollups for Secure Scalability](https://www.galois.com/articles/midnight-and-halo2-zk-rollups-for-secure-scalability#:~:text=Galois%20collaborated%20with%20Midnight%20and,source%20ZK%20library%20called%20Halo2)). This might future-proof the system if it grows (for instance, proving a whole set of compliance checks in one succinct proof).

- **zk-STARK:** STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are another class of ZK proof that uses no trusted setup and relies on hash-based cryptography (making them believed to be quantum-resistant). They can handle very large computations and have fast prover time for big problems, but the trade-off is **much larger proofs** (tens to hundreds of kilobytes) and slower verification on-chain. STARKs use symmetrical crypto (hashes and FFTs) rather than elliptic curves. In a scenario like ours, a STARK proof would indeed avoid trusted setups, but verifying a STARK on-chain (especially on a UTXO-based chain) could be challenging due to their size and verification complexity. Midnight’s focus has been on SNARKs (the documentation explicitly mentions SNARK proving system ([index | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/#:~:text=flexibility%20when%20selecting%20which%20data,and%20begin%20writing%20smart%20contracts)), and the use of Halo2). While STARKs are powerful, they may be less practical for Cardano/Midnight environment unless the chain provides specific support. Additionally, the statements we are proving (parsing a JSON and checking a string) are relatively small computations – a SNARK can handle those fine; we don’t necessarily need the scalability advantages of STARKs, and we prefer the smaller proof size for on-chain efficiency.

**Recommended choice:** Using **Halo2-based zkSNARKs** is the best fit for this project. Halo2 (or a Halo2-derived proving system) aligns with Midnight’s technology stack and avoids trusted setups while keeping proofs succinct ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20is%20designed%20to%20function,interoperability%20for%20hybrid%20blockchain%20applications)). The fact that Input-Output Global demonstrated Halo2 on Cardano mainnet ([Cardano deploys first zero-knowledge smart contract, expanding blockchain capabilities](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-deploys-first-zero-knowledge-smart-contract-expanding-blockchain-capabilities/#:~:text=The%20ZK%20smart%20contract%20Halo2,Midnight%2C%20to%20integrate%20with%20Cardano)) and collaborated on Halo2 for Midnight ([Galois - Midnight and Halo2: ZK Rollups for Secure Scalability](https://www.galois.com/articles/midnight-and-halo2-zk-rollups-for-secure-scalability#:~:text=Galois%20recently%20wrapped%20up%20a,source%20ZK%20library%20called%20Halo2)) gives confidence that this system will be supported and optimized. In practice, if we develop our verification logic with Midnight’s Compact framework, we will inherently be using whatever SNARK backend Midnight provides – which, given all indications, is a Halo2-like SNARK (possibly a Plonkish proof with trustless setup and fast verification). This means we don’t necessarily manually choose Halo2 vs PLONK in code; we write the high-level logic and Midnight’s prover uses its default (which is likely Halo2). If we were to implement externally, we could directly use the open-source Halo2 library ([Galois - Midnight and Halo2: ZK Rollups for Secure Scalability](https://www.galois.com/articles/midnight-and-halo2-zk-rollups-for-secure-scalability#:~:text=blockchain%2C%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9CMidnight%2C%E2%80%9D%20developed,source%20ZK%20library%20called%20Halo2)) in Rust to build the circuit and generate proofs, then create a verification contract for it. But using Midnight’s native route is simpler.

In summary, **zk-SNARKs** (especially Halo2 or PLONK variants) are preferred for this use-case due to their succinct proofs and integration. **zk-STARKs** are less suitable mainly because of verification cost on-chain. The design will therefore leverage a SNARK-friendly approach – and we will trust Midnight’s upgradable proving system to maintain state-of-the-art performance and security over time ([index | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/#:~:text=flexibility%20when%20selecting%20which%20data,and%20begin%20writing%20smart%20contracts)).

## System Architecture and Workflow  
Finally, we outline the overall architecture, combining the above components into a coherent system for off-chain proof generation and on-chain verification on Midnight:

1. **Character File Ingestion and Commitment:** The process begins with the agent owner preparing their `character.json`. They compute a cryptographic **hash H** of the entire file (for example, using SHA-256 or Blake2b). This hash H serves as the **public identity of the character file** on-chain. The owner can register this H on the Midnight blockchain (e.g. in a dedicated registry contract or simply by including it in the first proof transaction) so that others know a certain hash corresponds to a certain agent. The actual file remains off-chain and secret, but H is the commitment to it.

2. **Smart Contract Deployment:** A **Midnight smart contract** is written (in Compact TS) that will be used to verify proofs about character files. This contract includes:
   - A stored mapping or record of known character file hashes and perhaps which proofs (properties) have been verified for each (this helps in case multiple properties need checking over time). For simplicity, assume one contract per character file: it could store its hash and fields to mark which statements are proven.
   - An **entrypoint circuit** for each type of query. For example, `proveTopic(queryTopic: string)` circuit will internally call the witness to get the character data, check if `queryTopic` is in the topics list, then output a boolean or set a state flag. Another entrypoint `proveNoForbidden(queryPhrase: string)` could check that phrase is absent from all lore. In practice, we might design a single generic circuit that can handle arbitrary queries (taking a flag for inclusion/exclusion), but separate circuits can be simpler to implement and audit.
   - The contract uses **explicit disclosure** for only the outputs that need to be public. For instance, it will `disclose()` the commitment hash (so we can tie the proof to H on-chain) and the result of the check (the true/false outcome), while never disclosing the actual content checked ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=explicit%20exception%2C%20reducing%20the%20risk,of%20accidental%20disclosure)) ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=Explicitly%20declaring%20intent%20to%20disclose,by%20the%20following%20trivial%20program)). This ensures privacy is preserved by default, and only the minimal information leaves the shielded realm.

3. **Off-Chain Proof Generation (per query):** Whenever the agent owner (or someone in possession of the character file) wants to prove a certain statement, they will run the following:
   - Use the **Midnight DApp connector** to call the appropriate contract entrypoint locally. For example, call `proveTopic("Cardano")` on the contract. The DApp connector will invoke the `getCharacter()` witness callback, providing the contract code with the full JSON data in-memory ([Explicit disclosure | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/explicit_disclosure#:~:text=The%20contract%20produced%20from%20a,considered%20to%20be%20witness%20data)). 
   - The contract’s logic executes with that witness, and the Midnight runtime (or client-side SDK) produces a ZK proof that the execution was correct. Essentially, the owner’s machine acts as a prover, executing the contract code in a special ZK context. This yields a proof (and an assembled transaction) that includes: the contract address, the entrypoint called, the disclosed outputs (H and the result), and the proof blob attesting to it.
   - This proof confirms that *“Given hidden character data with hash H, the statement (e.g. topic includes 'Cardano') holds true”*. The proof is bundled in a transaction to send to the Midnight network.

4. **On-Chain Verification and Update:** The transaction with the proof is submitted to the Midnight blockchain. The validators verify the proof against the contract’s verification key (this is automatic in Midnight’s ZK-powered execution model ([Smart contracts on Midnight | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts#:~:text=Transcripts%20and%20ZK%20Snarks))). If the proof is valid, the contract state is updated. For example, the contract might set `hasCardanoTopic = true` in its public state for that character. The transaction might also emit an event or simply be queryable to see that “Proof of topic ‘Cardano’ included = true for file H” was recorded. At this point, on-chain verification is complete – the network has accepted the proof, so the chain now contains an **attestation** that the property is verified. If the proof had been invalid (e.g. the character file didn’t actually contain the topic), the transaction would be rejected and nothing would update, giving strong security guarantees.

5. **External Querying and Use of Proofs:** Now that the result is on-chain, anyone who needs to verify the statement can simply check the blockchain. For instance, if this process was done to assure a community that *AgentX* (hash H) isn’t programmed to shill a particular token, the community can inspect the contract state for AgentX’s hash H and see flags like `noShillToken=true` (as an example) confirmed by the blockchain. They do not need to trust the agent creator’s word; the proof was verified under consensus. This approach could be extended – e.g., a governance smart contract could require that an agent provide such proofs before being allowed to perform certain on-chain actions, effectively gating agent behavior by proven compliance. The important result is a **verifiable credential on-chain** about the agent’s character file.

6. **Tooling & Development Workflow:** Throughout this architecture, **Midnight’s developer tools** play a central role. The developer would use Midnight’s CLI and libraries to compile the Compact contract and deploy it. The **TypeScript DSL** makes it easier to manipulate JSON-like structures without needing low-level cryptography knowledge ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20uses%20TypeScript,attestation%20without%20revealing%20sensitive%20information)) ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=,developers%20to%20master%20ZK%20technology)). The proving process is handled by Midnight’s runtime, so the developer doesn’t manually deal with elliptic curve computations – they write business logic and the platform “snarkifies” it. Additionally, testing the circuits off-chain with sample JSON data (possibly using Midnight’s local devnet or unit test harness) would be part of development to ensure the checks work as intended. Tools like the **Midnight JS API** allow the DApp to orchestrate the proof generation and transaction submission from a Node.js environment ([Midnight APIs | Midnight Docs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/#:~:text=)). By leveraging these tools, the implementation is streamlined: we focus on the conditions to prove (e.g. substring search) and let the Midnight framework handle proof correctness and security.

In conclusion, the plan enables **selective proof of content** for ElizaOS agent files: an agent operator can prove facts about their agent’s configuration in zero-knowledge, and a Midnight smart contract will verify and record these facts on-chain for others to trust. This marries the structured nature of `character.json` with Midnight’s privacy-preserving smart contracts, achieving both transparency and confidentiality. Using a robust zkSNARK system (preferably Halo2 via Midnight’s stack) ensures the proofs are efficient and trustless ([Midnight: Enhancing Blockchain Data Privacy and Security | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/midnight-enhancing-blockchain-data-privacy-and-security/#:~:text=Midnight%20is%20designed%20to%20function,interoperability%20for%20hybrid%20blockchain%20applications)). With this architecture, one can, for example, confidently assert *“Our AI agent’s policy forbids it from promoting any specific token (as verified on Midnight)”*, without ever exposing the agent’s full persona file. This fosters trust in AI agents’ alignment and behavior in a decentralized, verifiable way.
